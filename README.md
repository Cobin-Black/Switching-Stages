IMPORTANT:
  Game has a few exploits: Wall clipping, Momentum (inside walls)
  There is also a bug with wall jump where the player will sometimes just not get enough push velocity. I only happen to get it once but my friend gets it a lot more than me.

For the character movment I used Dawnosaur's platformer movment code to help me understand some fundamentals; so I will link that here:

This is my first game I've developed so its not the best thing in the world, but it's a fun enough concept that I might expand upon in the future.

August 2025 update: I added the .zip file to files so the game can actully be played since I forgot to do that. Just need to click on the .zip file I uploaded then do view raw to get it downloaded. Unzip it then you should be able to run it on your computer.
